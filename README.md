# oh hi there ðŸ‘‹
it's me, geraldo

what's up?

- making flutter apps that don't crash (usually)
- breaking configs (frequently)
- fixing configs (occasionally)

tech stuff i dig
flutter & dart â†’ because pretty UI makes the pain go away
linux â†’ because i enjoy trying to get Microsoft Teams to work

oh and i write sometimes, fantasy stuff that i may someday put online.... or not, we'll see!
